# LEGO-ifying Meshes

## Project Overview
In this assignment, I made a Houdini project that can convert any faceted mesh to a collection of LEGO pieces.

## Creating your node
I created a custom node in the nodes window that you will enter and add nodes within; this will be your LEGO-ifying node.

## LEGO bricks
For this assignment, I to support three overall categories of LEGO brick:

2x2 Block bricks

And all exposed tops have round tops

## Color the bricks
Here you can see my attempt to use the attribute transfer to add color to the mesh.

Although the texture might not be working, we can see that the pink color is transferred to the rest of the bricks.
